= CsvImport

This gem makes easy to map CSV columns to database fields. Just add it to your Gemfile and setup the routes for your model. For instance if you want to use it for your Product model it would be this:

csv_import_resource :product

Then run run ```rake routes``` and you will see the routes for the CSV import.

Currently it only works with ActiveRecord but support for other ORM's like DataMapper, Mongoid is coming soon.

Enjoy!
